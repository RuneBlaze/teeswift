teeswift
=================

Faster treeswift, powered by LuaJIT. Heavily WIP.

It will also likely be less ergonomic and more
bug-prone than the original version, but that is
not the point. After all we are writing research software.

## What?

This will be a LuaJIT version of [treeswift](https://github.com/niemasd/TreeSwift).

## Why?

This is somewhat likely to be a bad idea (that is
why I only dare to do it in my off hours...). The
reason is because LuaJIT is *the* de-facto fastest dynamically typed
language, and honestly I believe LuaJIT
leads to a more natural API compared to Python.
